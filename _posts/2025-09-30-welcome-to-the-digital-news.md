The presses are rolling again, this time with a full dose of automation. While the Monochrome Generator continues to randomize palettes and jittery SVG faces, we wanted a permanent home where we could publish updates, tutorials, and the occasional caffeine-fueled editorial.

Here’s what’s new:

- **A proper Jekyll foundation.** The site is now compatible with GitHub Pages, making deployments a one-branch affair.
- **Reusable layouts and includes.** No more copy-pasting huge HTML blobs—everything lives in `_layouts` and `_includes` where it belongs.
- **Room for stories.** Posts live under `_posts`, so expect future dispatches about color theory, animation techniques, and maybe even tea reviews.

If you’re curious how the generator works or want to suggest improvements, peek at the repo and open an issue. Until then, refresh that palette and keep an eye on the blog.
